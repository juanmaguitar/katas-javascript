## Instructions

Create a useful model of a standard 52-card deck of cards:

4 suits - spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs
13 ranks - Ace, two to ten, Jack, Queen, King
I should be able to draw a poker hand (5 card draw, not Texas hold 'em) and identify useful properties of the hand :

Is there a pair of card? (e.g. two Aces)
Is there three of a kind?
Four of a kind?
Are there two pairs?
Is there a straight? (e.g. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of any suit)
Is there a flush? (e.g. 2, 4, 6, 8, King - all of Hearts)
What is the highest/lowest card?
